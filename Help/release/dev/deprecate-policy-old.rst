deprecate-policy-old
--------------------

* An explicit deprecation diagnostic was added for policy ``CMP0071``
  (``CMP0071`` and below were already deprecated).
  The :manual:`cmake-policies(7)` manual explains that the OLD behaviors
  of all policies are deprecated and that projects should port to the
  NEW behaviors.

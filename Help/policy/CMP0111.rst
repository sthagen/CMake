.. versionadded:: 3.19

An imported target with a missing location fails during generation.

Prior to this the location would be generated as ``<TARGET_NAME>-NOTFOUND``,
which would result in build failures.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to generate the location of an imported
unknown, static or shared library target as ``<TARGET_NAME>-NOTFOUND`` if not
set.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to raise an error.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.19.  CMake version |release|
warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
